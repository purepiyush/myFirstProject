            <h3>Pashmina</h3>
            <p>Pashmina is made from an exotic wool fiber, known for its finesse, softness, warmth and beauty. It is a fine product attained from a breed of goats known as chanthangi goat, that are reared within the Tibetan area of 4000 meters in winter. </p>

            <h3>Merino wool</h3>
            <p>It is fine wool with the diameter of each fiber ranging roughly around 18 microns to 24 microns. From this we get the high end finished products. </p>
        </div><div class="productscol">
            <h3>Semi Pashmina</h3>
            <p>Pure pashmina is very expensive due to the availability and the processes involved in making each piece. To make it more affordable, automation is required. As Pashmina cant tolerate the high tension induced by the machines, the whole process to make is handmade. </p>
